                <p><strong>During the early 2000s, the fight against copyright infringement expanded into lawsuits against individual 
                users of file sharing software. Popular file sharing sites like Napster allowed users to share mp3 music files
                to such an extent that questions of copyright infringement arose from major music labels and their artists. 
                As a result many file sharing programs and services have been shut down due to litigation by groups such as the RIAA and MPAA. 
                The economic impact on media industries is disputed; although publishers and copyright holders claim 
                economic damage, some studies argue that file sharing is not the primary cause of declines in sales. To help counteract the inevitable
                use of file sharing sites like BitTorrent, music streaming services were established to gain revenue. Users pay a monthly fee to have
                legal access to music catalogs. File sharing remains widespread, with mixed public opinion 
                about the legal and moral practice of it for commercial material.
